## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Change to mobile version with a click
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

My biggest learning was about the usage of flex. Without using javascript, I found that the best way to make a dynamic responsiveness with flex was using more divs and spans in the HTML code.

For example, in the animation below, where I reduce the size of the viewport, I used a span tag together with the cellphone picture in an extra flex div container (div.container) to force the image to the right when the size of the div.container is the default size (--fixed-size-1).

When we reduce the size of the viewport and the div.container shrinks, the space between the span and the img tag gets smaller until it reaches 0. After that, as the width of div.container gets smaller than the image width, the image is now fixed to the left side and the width leftovers are just moved out of the section container (section.container). That's a mechanic that only flex could make so simple.

![Example picture](previewer/images/example.webp)

```html
<section class="container">
  <div class="image">
    <div class="container">
      <span></span>
      <img src="...">
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    ...
  </div>
</section>
```
```css
section.container
{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
}
.image
{
    order: 1;
    position: relative;

    width: var(--fixed-size-1);
    align-self: stretch;
    
    margin-left: 20px;
}
div.container
{
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;

    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
div.container>img
{
    width: 767px;
    height: auto;
    
    padding-left: 175px;
    padding-right: var(--fixed-size-2);
}
```

We can note that combined with it, the section.container is also flexed and there is space around the .image and the .text containers that gets smaller when the viewport is reduced. My goal with it all was to make the background of the cellphones picture centered with it when the viewport is big, but sticked to the left (as in the [proposed design](design/desktop-design.jpg)) when it is small, with a nice dynamic responsiveness.

Obs.: The reason why I used another div (the div.container) to flex the image with the span tag and not the .image was that the image should be absolute positioned so the height of the section.container wasn't influenced by its size and its vertical leftovers were in front of the section below (the one with the "Why choose Easybank?" header).

### Continued development
<!-- ### Next steps -->

- Possibly add some parallax effects in the future.
- Add aria-hidden="true" in the elements that doesn,t need to be read by accessibility APIs.

### Useful resources

- [Previewer app](https://gbellos.github.io/easybank-challenge/previewer/previewer.html) - I made this app to help me visualize all the svg files.
