## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Change to mobile version with a click
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
<!-- - Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

My biggest learning was about using flex. Without javascript, the best way to use it to make a dynamic responsiveness was to use more divs in the HTML code.

Example:

![Example](previewer/images/example.webp)
<!-- 
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->

### Continued development
<!-- ### Next steps -->

Possibly add some parallax effects in the future.
